// this is a spec for the MQM map file format

// map are saved in text file format, with .mqm file extension
// you can edit these levels with any text editor
// the map can be split into two floors using different tiles

// NOTE: text editors don't really use fonts with characters with sqare aspect ratio,
//  so the resulting level might end up looking a little stretched in-game
// with some text editors, you can change text spacing to circumvent the issue

// tiles marked with the ^ character can change height when upper case (move them to ther upper floor)
//    for instance: you can use 'S' instead of 's' if you want the start to be on the 2nd floor



s ^ : start
f ^ : finish

# : full-height wall
w : mid-height wall
c : lower ceiling
p : platform between 1st and 2nd floor
e : elevator that takes you to the 2nd floor



// here is a very simple example level
// with size 8x8

// finish is on a elevated platform made with walls (w), where you can't get without the elevator (e)
