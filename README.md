# how to build
- get the [Odin compiler](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin)
- add Odin to `$PATH` enviroment variable
- use `.\build.bat` command to build the game  
- use `.\build.bat run` command to build and run the game  

# creating maps
more in-depth info is in [DOQM file spec](doqm_format_spec.md)  
Maps are made as top-down view on the map, and different ascii characters correspond to different tiles - this means anyone can edit maps with just a simple text editor
